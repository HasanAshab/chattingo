## üê≥ Part 1: Local Docker Setup Demonstration (1.5 minutes)

### Script:
"Hello! I'm going to demonstrate the Chattingo real-time chat application. Let's start with the local Docker setup."

### Actions:
1. **Show Project Structure**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to project directory
   cd chattingo

   # Show the project structure
   tree -L 2
   ```

   **Say**: "Chattingo is a full-stack application with React frontend, Spring Boot backend, and MySQL database, all containerized with Docker."

2. **Show Docker Compose Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Display docker-compose.yml
   cat docker-compose.yml
   ```

   **Say**: "Our docker-compose.yml defines three services: frontend on port 3000, backend on port 8080, and MySQL database with health checks and proper networking."

3. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Show environment files
   ls -la */.*env*

   # Show sample backend env
   cat backend/.env.example
   ```

   **Say**: "Each service has its own environment configuration for database connections, JWT secrets, and CORS settings."

4. **Start the Application**
   ```bash
   # Build and start all services
   docker-compose up --build -d

   # Show running containers
   docker-compose ps

   # Show logs
   docker-compose logs -f --tail=10
   ```

   **Say**: "Docker Compose builds all services, handles dependencies, and starts them in the correct order. Notice the health checks ensuring services are ready before dependent services start."

## üîß Part 2: Jenkins Pipeline Execution (2 minutes)

### Script:
"Now let's look at our sophisticated CI/CD pipeline built with Jenkins."

### Actions:
1. **Show Jenkins Dashboard**
   - Navigate to Jenkins UI
   - Show the `chattingo` folder with three pipelines

   **Say**: "Our CI/CD architecture uses an orchestrator pattern with three pipelines: the main orchestrator, frontend pipeline, and backend pipeline."

2. **Explain Pipeline Architecture**
   ```bash
   # Show the main Jenkinsfile
   cat Jenkinsfile
   ```

   **Say**: "The orchestrator pipeline uses intelligent change detection - it only builds services that have actual code changes, making our builds efficient and fast."

3. **Trigger a Pipeline**
   - Make a small change to frontend code
   - Commit and push to trigger webhook

   **Say**: "I'm making a small change to trigger our GitHub webhook. Watch how Jenkins automatically detects the change and starts the pipeline."

4. **Show Pipeline Execution**
   - Show the orchestrator pipeline running
   - Click into the frontend pipeline
   - Show parallel stages running

   **Say**: "Notice the parallel execution - linting, testing, security scanning with Trivy, OWASP dependency checks, and SonarQube code quality analysis all run simultaneously."

5. **Show Security Features**
   - Point out Trivy vulnerability scanning
   - Show OWASP dependency check results
   - Show SonarQube integration

   **Say**: "Security is built into every step - we scan for vulnerabilities in dependencies, Docker images, and maintain code quality standards."

## üíª Part 3: Live Application Walkthrough (2 minutes)

### Script:
"Let's explore the live Chattingo application and see how it works."

### Actions:
1. **Access the Application**
   ```bash
   # Open browser to localhost:3000
   open http://localhost:3000
   ```

   **Say**: "Here's our Chattingo application running locally. It features a modern, responsive design built with React and Material-UI."

2. **User Registration**
   - Show registration form
   - Create a new user account

   **Say**: "The registration process is secure with JWT-based authentication. All passwords are hashed and stored securely."

3. **Login Process**
   - Login with the created account
   - Show JWT token in browser dev tools (Network tab)

   **Say**: "Upon login, the backend generates a JWT token for secure, stateless authentication."

4. **Dashboard Overview**
   - Show the main chat interface
   - Point out user list, chat area, message input

   **Say**: "The dashboard provides a clean interface for real-time messaging with user management and chat functionality."

## ‚≠ê Part 4: Key Features Demonstration (2.5 minutes)

### Script:
"Let me demonstrate the core features that make Chattingo special."

### Actions:
1. **Real-time Messaging**
   - Open two browser windows (different users)
   - Send messages between users
   - Show instant delivery

   **Say**: "Real-time messaging is powered by WebSocket technology using STOMP.js and SockJS. Messages appear instantly without page refresh."

2. **User Management**
   - Show user list
   - Demonstrate user search/discovery
   - Show online status indicators

   **Say**: "Users can discover other users and see their online status in real-time."

3. **Group Chat Features**
   - Create a group chat
   - Add multiple users
   - Send group messages

   **Say**: "Chattingo supports group conversations where multiple users can participate in the same chat room."

4. **Technical Features Demo**
   - Open browser dev tools
   - Show WebSocket connection in Network tab
   - Show real-time message flow
   - Demonstrate responsive design on mobile view

   **Say**: "The technical implementation uses WebSocket for real-time communication, and the interface is fully responsive for mobile devices."

5. **Security Features**
   - Show secure HTTPS connection (if available)
   - Demonstrate JWT token expiration handling
   - Show CORS protection in action

   **Say**: "Security features include JWT authentication, CORS protection, and secure WebSocket connections."

## üöÄ Part 5: Production Deployment Showcase (1.5 minutes)

### Script:
"Finally, let's see how Chattingo deploys to production automatically."

### Actions:
1. **Show Production Environment**
   ```bash
   # SSH to VPS (or show VPS dashboard)
   ssh -i ~/.ssh/chattingo_vps root@72.60.111.27

   # Show running containers
   docker ps

   # Show docker-compose setup
   cd chattingo-compose && cat docker-compose.yml
   ```

   **Say**: "Our production environment runs on a VPS with the same Docker setup, ensuring consistency between development and production."

2. **Demonstrate Automated Deployment**
   - Show the chattingo-compose repository
   - Make a change to main branch
   - Show Jenkins pipeline triggering
   - Show automatic deployment to VPS

   **Say**: "When code is merged to main, Jenkins automatically builds, tests, pushes to Docker Hub, updates the compose repository, and deploys to production."

3. **Show Production Application**
   - Access the live production URL
   - Show the same features working in production

   **Say**: "Here's Chattingo running in production with the same features, demonstrating our complete CI/CD pipeline from code to deployment."

4. **Infrastructure Highlights**
   - Show Docker Hub registry with images
   - Show monitoring/logging capabilities
   - Show backup and recovery setup

   **Say**: "Our production setup includes container registry, automated backups, and comprehensive logging for monitoring and troubleshooting."
